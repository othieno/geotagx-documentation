# Task Presenter Configuration

## I. Introduction

Creating a [task presenter](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/overview.html#task-presenter) for your PyBossa project requires prior knowledge of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, and/or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). These programming languages are relatively simple to learn however the creation process can be very time-consuming depending on the size and scope of a project. To mitigate this issue, the PyBossa platform provides a set of pre-built project templates that can be used as foundations for new projects.
