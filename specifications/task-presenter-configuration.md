# Task Presenter Configuration

## I. Introduction

Creating a [task presenter](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/overview.html#task-presenter) for your PyBossa project requires prior knowledge of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, and/or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). These programming languages are relatively simple to learn however the creation process can be very time-consuming depending on the size and scope of a project. To mitigate this issue, the PyBossa platform provides a set of pre-built project templates that can be used as foundations for new projects.

**[TODO]** Write disadvantages of template approach.

As an alternative, this document will introduce the *task presenter configuration*, a well-defined specification that aims to resolve these shortcomings.

It is our hope that by providing tools to manage task presenter configurations as well as generate HTML, JavaScript and CSS code from them, the creation process becomes simpler and much quicker since project creators focus more on the content of their projects without having to worry about technical details.
